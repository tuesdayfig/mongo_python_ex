#Choice of Language

#Status: Processing

#Context: Assignment 5/6 is to modify a ZMQ example to use Ansible, rather than Docker Compose

#Decision: Despite PHP being an older language and widely used, Python has a large libary support. Python is much easier to use with databases.

3/29/19 Basic ADRs updated. No modifications needed to Python code.

#Consequences: Python is much easier to learn with its leniancy with syntax and grammatical errors. PHP is an older language and has a larger community. Python is about 3x slower than PHP 7.
